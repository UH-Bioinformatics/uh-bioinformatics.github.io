subtitle: The Bioinformatics Core at the University of Hawaii

Mission
-------

The mission of the Bioinformatics Core is to facilitate and accelerate
life science research through the provision of expertise in
bioinformatics and computational biology, and to advance the
educational mission of the University of Hawaii in bioinformatics
through workshops and training relevant to today's high-throughput and
big-data biology. The Core's activities are centered around three main themes, namely:

+	 Support and consultation services;
+ 	 Development and implementation of bioinformatics education programs;
+ 	 Contribution of original and novel bioinformatics methods and tools.


The Bioinformatics Core was founded to build upon the original efforts of the <a
href="">INBRE</a>, <a href="http://pceidr.jabsom.hawaii.edu/">COBRE</a>, <a href="">EPScoR</a> and <a
href="">RCMI</a> infrastructure grants by providing broader
bioinformatics support through a collaborative, recharge based or
retainer service models to researchers across the University of Hawaii
System.

In addition to its bioinformatics-centric activities, the core is
actively engaged in facilitating access to the state-of-the-art
computational infrastructure maintained by <a href="">Cyberinfrastructure</a>. Our Core offers
expertise in distributed and multicore programming, code
optimization, web development, as well as  biological databases design
and maintenance.

Location
--------

The Bioinformatics Core is located in the Information Technology
Center building (ITS) on Manoa Campus. Additionally the Core has a
dedicated lab space in the [Department of Tropical Medicine, Medical
Microbiology, and
Pharmacology](http://manoa.hawaii.edu/tropicalmedicine/ "JABSOM").


Resources
---------

#### Computational resource

Coming soon

#### Software resources

The core provides access to various open source and commercial
software. For an exhaustive list, see the <a href="">Infrastucture
Support</a> page. Some computationally intensive applications have
been configured to run on the University of Hawaii HPC ( See <a
href="">Cyber Infrastructure information page</a> for details on how
to obtain an account).
