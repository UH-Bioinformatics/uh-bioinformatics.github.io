Phylogenetic inference has become a core part of any modern
evolutionary analysis and has found important applications in
biomedical research, ecology, microbiology, to cite only a few
fields. To adapt and leverage the deluge of genomics data that is
commonly generate in high-throughput sequencing methods, new
phylogenetics methods are continuously proposed. To familiarize users
with popular approaches and new development in this field, [UH
Cyberinfrastructure](http://www.hawaii.edu/its/ci/ "Cyberinfrastructure") Bioinformatice Core, in conjunction with the
Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence ([COBRE-PCEIDR](http://pceidr.jabsom.hawaii.edu/ "COBRE-PCEID")) and the
Research Centers for Minority Institutions ([RCMI-BRIDGES](http://rcmi-bridges.jabsom.hawaii.edu/ "RCMI-BRIDGES")) is offering
a half-day introductory workshop on phylogenetics and
phylogenomics. This short overview is targeted towards graduate
students, post-docs, researchers and faculty members of the University
of Hawaii System.

The workshop will review a broad range of topics ranging from
elementary concepts such as sequence alignment, and evolutionary model
selection, to more advanced ones such as tree calibration. The
workshop contains a hands-on component during which users will be
building, optimizing and visualizing trees using a suite of popular
tools.
