An Introduction to Molecular Phylogenetic Inference
---------------------------------------------------


Phylogenetic inference has become a core part of any modern
evolutionary analysis and has found important applications in
biomedical research, ecology, microbiology, to cite only a few
fields. To adapt and leverage the deluge of genomics data that is
commonly generate in high-throughput sequencing methods, new
phylogenetics methods are continuously proposed. To familiarize users
with popular approaches and new development in this field, UH
Cyberinfrastructure, in conjunction with Centers of Biomedical
Research Excellence (COBRE) is offering a half-day introductory
workshop on phylogenetics and phylogenomics. This short overview is
targeted towards graduate students, post-docs, researchers and faculty
members of the University of Hawaii System.

The workshop will review a broad range of topics ranging from
elementary concepts such as sequence alignment, and evolutionary model
selection, to more advanced ones such as tree calibration. The
workshop contains a hands-on component during which users will be
building, optimizing and visualizing trees using a suite of popular
tools.

Date and Location
-----------------

The workshop will be held on September 9th, 2016 from 9 am to 1 pm in the Information Technology Center building (ITS) on Manoa Campus (2520 Correa Road, Honolulu, Hawaii 96822), room 105A.
